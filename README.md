# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).


## Backend base URL configuration

- Local/dev: set `EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` (already present). Example: `http://192.168.x.x:3500`.
- Production builds: set `EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `.env.production`. This value is embedded at build time. Example currently:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://geode-backend-834952308922.us-central1.run.app
```

If the backend address changes, update the respective file and restart the dev server (for dev) or rebuild the app (for production).

## When installing new packages:
npx expo install __
npx pod-install ios
npx expo run   (ios)
npx expo run --device

npx expo start
