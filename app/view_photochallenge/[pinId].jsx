/*  
    This file is a placeholder to allow deep linking to the photo challenge screen with a specific pinId, 
    using the syntax /view_photochallenge/[pinId]. The actual logic for handling the pinId and displaying 
    the photo challenge is in view_photochallenge.jsx, which checks for the presence of a pinId param and 
    adjusts its behavior accordingly. This file just re-exports the main component to keep the routing 
    structure clean.
