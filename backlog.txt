using AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage' is not as clean as using firebase/auth. I should be using this instead to store user state -- it is more secure. Do this later.


Integrate Firebase
-Ensure security protocols
-Have firebase handle login authentication
-Firebase for Image upload storage
    -Image compression
-Firebase Firestore? 
-Cloudflare?



Steps to MVP:
1. Have a user login page (firebase)
2. Save user login data to database
3. On map have 1 button: create new challenge
    -enter challenge prompt + take photo
    -this saves challenge coords in mongodb. pin appears on map
4. profile stays under user


Should have test cases
Should be using better AI integration




should use async storage to cache things (like pins, etc.): https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage


Use mongoose in mongodb:
    -much better
